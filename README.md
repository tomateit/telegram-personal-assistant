# Telegram Assistant 
*based on Telegram Core API [via telethon](https://pypi.org/project/Telethon/)*

This is a self-hosted solution that takes advantage of telegram client functionality and provides some non standart features.
1. The purpose of this project is to integrate some NLP techniques into usage of Telegram
2. Currently it's more of a demo app, not something ready-to-use
